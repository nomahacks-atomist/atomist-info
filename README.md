# Atomist at NomaHacks

Atomist is a platform for delivery automation from git push to deployment. See [the docs](https://docs.atomist.com/) and [the website](https://atomist.com) for more info.

## What can I do with Atomist?

### 1. Keep posted on project activity, take action in Slack

Use Atomist for Slack notifications about activity on your repos and do useful things, like open and manage issues, raise and merge PRs, and more.

**How to set this up**

1. Create or join a Slack channel in https://nomahacks.slack.com/
2. `/invite @atomist` to the channel. You'll be prompted to choose a repo to map. This is the repo that you'll get notifications from.
